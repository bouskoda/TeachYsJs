Jasmine Tests
=============

Jasmine (http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine) is a JavaScript BDD library developed by [Pivotal](http://pivotallabs.com).  Unlike many BDD frameworks, Jasmine writes its specifications directly in JavaScript rather than in structured natural language.

This directory contains a couple of simple Jasmine tests to test the calculator example and to show some features of the JavaScript language.

To run the tests, simply open the CalcTestRunner.html file in a modern browser like Chrome and the test specs will be used to run the tests.

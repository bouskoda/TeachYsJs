Teach Yourself JavaScript - Solutions
=====================================

This directory contains the solutions to the Teach Yourself JavaScript exercises.  The content of this directory is as follows:

* `js` - the JavaScript files for the Calculator and its enclosing AMD module
* `plain-utest` - simple QUnit unit tests that test the Calculator, without using RequireJS and AMD modules
* `qunit-plain-index.html` - the HTML file to open to run the plan QUnit tests
* `qunit-requirejs-index.html` - the HTML file to open to run the modularised QUnit tests that are run via RequireJS
* `requirejs-utest` - the JavaScript files implementing the modularised QUnit tests
* `requirejs-utestmain.js` - the RequireJS "data-main" script which RequireJS uses to load and run the modules in the tests

There is also a `jastest` directory that contains some example Jasmine BDD tests for the calculator (it has its own README)
